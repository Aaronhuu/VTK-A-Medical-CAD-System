# VTK-A-Medical-CAD-System
Based on PyQt4 and vtk 7.0.0


This Project is made for helping the brace making industry to simplify the technology process.
Use vtk and qt as sdks
Function:  

            1. read .stl file,
            2. smooth filter
            3. add point to the model to determine the position of spline
            4. create the qt window
            4. reshape the model of the body 
            5. modify the brace (haven't finish)
            6. create new .stl file as the brace (haven't finish)
            7. Use 3d printer to print the brace (haven't finish)


If you are looking at this file, feel free to download and change. I have learned qt and vtk for basic, I think I should be able to help anyone who want to start learning vtk and qt. (in python)
This project haven't finished yet, some functions still need to be made. 

You can contact me if any code is unclear, I will reply ASAP:

This reprostory contains all the test file I made. Before you run the __init__.py in CADwindow, you should install:

  1. python (my version is 2.7, I am not sure whether your version will work).
  2. VTK for python ( 7.0.0 If your verison is below 5, you may find some code cannot run in your IDE. Download the latest version at: http://www.vtk.org/download/).
  3. PyQt4
  
You can easily download VTK from homebrew use :

          brew install vtk
       
It will download the latest version for you.

This is my Final Year Project, and it is the biggest chellenge I have ever made in my university life. I will be really appreciated if anyone can help me.
